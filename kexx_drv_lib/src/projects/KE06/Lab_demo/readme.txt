@par Example description
     ===================
This example provides a description of lab demo running on the FRDM_KE06Z boards, which shows the following demos:
1. Key input demo
	There's 2 keys, named as "up" and "down" key. The brightness of the RED LED will be increased when the "up" 
        key is pressed, and the brightness will be decreased when the "down" key is pressed.	
2. Accelerometer demo
	Read the data from accelerometer sensor part(MMA8451) through I2C bus and calculate angle change,
	then drive BLUE LED to change brightness by Flextimer.
3. RTC demo
	In RTC demo mode, the green LED blinks with 1Hz frequency generated by RTC interrupt.

The RTC demo is the defult demo when the FRDM_KE06Z board is not moved for a while.
	
@par Code configuration
   ===================
Make sure the following macros are defined in ke06_config.h:
   USE_FEE and \n
   EXT_CLK_FREQ_KHZ macro is defined to 8000(8Mhz).
	 
@par Directory contents
     ==================
	projects/Lab_demo      


@par Hardware environment
     ====================
 - Board: freedom FRDM-KE06Z, revA \n
  	 	Requirement for demo: \n

 - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 
  
@par How to use it
     =============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Rebuild all project files and load demo code into the device
- Connect J6 USB port to the computer that will find serial terminal port
- Open the serial terminal
- Configure the serial terminal to protocol: 8-N-1, 115200bps, and flow control: none
- Run the example
